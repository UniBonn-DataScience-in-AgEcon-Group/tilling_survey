# Tilling Survey for ILR

Run locally with

'''
npm run dev
'''

Change questions in src/questions.js. Specify the question id, question itself, the type (currently "text" and "radio") and the options (if type is "radio"). Adding a new array automatically creates a new page in the survey for the questions.
